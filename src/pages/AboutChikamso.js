            <p>Hi I am one of the creators of MagHour and I am going to tell you why we created MagHour<br/>We created Maghour because about coronavirus and we know that not everybody has a phone which they can use whatsapp like us so we decided to create MagHour<br/>I like doing coding sports until my leg hurted and I couldn't kick a ball or bend my leg. Ouch! The only things I don't like doing are learning languages and writing.<br/>Me and my sister all like doing similar things like coding, maths and sports and two of us don't like doing writing but the only thing that makes us not similar is that she likes learning languages but I don't.<br/>By the way I am in P5A and I am 9 years old so don't think I am in P7 because I've made this website because I'm not.<br/>I know what it feels like in your house not talking to anyone especially if you are the only one in your house and you don't have a phone.<br/>The reason why we don't just want to give it to you children is because you can use your own email for the signup so that's why we send it to your school and your school will probaly have all the parents email so that's why they will create your account and send your parents the password nd username so you can login.</p>
