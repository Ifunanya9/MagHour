        <h1>Information for Schools</h1>
        <p>
          We create a account for the school.
          <br />
          After the school gets the account then they create a account for the
          childrens with their parents account.
          <br />
          Also the school doesn't have to worry because this website is secure.
          <br />
          Also the teachers can also chat with each other so it's not only the
          childrens that can chat to each other.
        </p>
      </div>
    );
