              <h1>Information for Schools</h1>
              <p>
                We create a account for the school.
                <br />
                After the school gets the account then they create a account for
                the childrens with their parents email.
                <br />
                Also the school doesn't have to worry because this website is
                secure.
                <br />
                Also the teachers can also chat with each other so it's not only
                the childrens that can chat to each other.
                <br />
                The childrens have limited time that is 1 hour so that they can
                still do homework or get crafty because everyone knows that if
                you have to mny of screen time your eyes will hurt so much so we
                limited anyone that goes on the website 1 hour because we don't
                want any damaging eyes thanks to us and we just want people to
                get crafty and also to do homework.
