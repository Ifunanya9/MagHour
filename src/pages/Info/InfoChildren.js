              <h1>Information for Children</h1>
              <p>
                Children you can chat, make private and do anything but say bad
                words
                <br />
                You can chat to your teacher and friends and you can do anything
                you want except from being mean.
                <br />
                And we're not going to a allow people swearing,people being mean
                racism just act like you're at school so people will feel happy.
                <br />I know you won't be happy that your prents see what you do
                but it's very important because we know that some of you are
                very responsible and some not also if you type something like
                lets go out and play on the pavement and your parent doesn't
                know you might get in danger your parents might get into very
                big trouble.
                <br />
                Also if you don't have a computer you can use a phone and if you
                don't have a phone then you can use a tablet and I am pretty
                sure you have one of those and if you don't you can ask someone
                in your family for a device so you can talk to your friends.
                <br />
                I'm sorry but you are ony a loud on this website for 1 hour I am
                sorry but we limit screen time for you but if you need more time
                we will send email to your parent for a extra 30 minutes.
